### Please notice the project runs on the development server which serves products.json
### I wanted to simulate a real live scanario of fetching data from server.

### Run dev server

open cmd of your choice, navigate to the root of the project folder:

1. run "npm install" - to install all dependencies 
2. run "npm start" - to run the development server 
3. the project will be running on localhost:3000 

Enjoy the magic of React :)
